# Engineering-Projects
This is a compilation of the various DIY engineering projects I have made in the past few years. Each project has the materials, schematics, and general explanation for creating them (some of the older ones don't have all the details about them because I didn't realise I would be posting them during the time of creation). Any external access material I followed/ took inspiration from will also be linked. General parts for all these projects can be found in local/ online hardware shops and some materials are household scraps I found.
